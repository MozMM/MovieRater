# Movie Rater
### A Web app to search movies and rate them.
### Marta Mozelle - Sole Developer

## ‚≠ê  Project is in progress! 
### Structure is completed. Still to do: Frontend styling and adding further tests. 

### Project goals met: 
- Integrated calls to [The Movie Database API](themoviedb.org) for listing data. 
- Wrote backend API to store and serve rating data from site users. 

### Things to note:
- Worked with React-Redux selectors. These replace the need for connected components using Redux's connect(), mapState() and mapDispatch().
- This repo gives an example of testing I wrote. (Some tests in Spoon City are also my work.)

### Tech Stack
| React | Redux | Express | Sequelize | Node.js | Jest |
