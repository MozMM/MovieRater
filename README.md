# Movie Rater

## Marta Mozelle - Sole Developer

## ‚≠ê  Project is in progress! 
### Structure is complete. Still to do: Frontend styling and adding further tests. 

### What is it?
- Web app to search movies and rate them.
- Integrated calls to [The Movie Database API](themoviedb.org) for listing data. 
- Wrote backend API to store and serve rating data from site users. 

### Things to note:
- Worked with React-Redux selectors. These replace the need for Redux's connect() & connected components with mapState and mapDispatch functions. Found it to be more consise. 
- This repo gives an example of testing I wrote. (Some testing in Spoon City is also my work)

### Tech Stack
| React | Redux | Express | Sequelize | Node.js | Jest |
